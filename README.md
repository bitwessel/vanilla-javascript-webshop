This is a vanilla-javascript webshop, *made by myself* for a *school project*, but besides the minimal requirements I tried to add some functions myself.

It's my first real website with functionalities to display what I've learned in previous modules
about javascript.

The goal was to use localstorage and build a webshop that has products that you can add and remove from the shopping cart and favourite page.

WIP 
1. styling
2. updating-status
3. making components and function out of reusable code (Refacturing)
